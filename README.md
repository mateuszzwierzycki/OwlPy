# OwlPy
A bunch of scripts easing out the Owl/TensorFlow workflow. Alpha.

## Deployment
As this library is currently very under construction, I'm not even trying to put the code in packages. Treat is as a snippet repo.

## What
This project is a bunch of helper functions which I'm developing for the fluent Owl/.NET/Python/Accord/TensorFlow pipeline.
Developed in Pycharm.

## Structure
There are 2 main folders here:
- owl_py, which might one day become a nice package
- Examples, where I provide some exemplary data for training AND the actual code to run the TensorFlow framework using this data.
